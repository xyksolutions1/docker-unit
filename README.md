## About

This will build a Docker Image for [Unit](https://unit.nginx.org), A high performance application server. This is a base image that can serve static files. You will likely need to use a different downstream image if you wish to serve PHP files such as [tiredofit/unit-php](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-unit-php)

- Supports various Node, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby runtime engines
- Auto configuration generation and import
- Metrics collection
- Log Shipping support

## Installation
### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build -t (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/unit).

```
docker pull tiredofit/unit:(imagetag)
```

Builds of the image are also available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/tiredofit/unit/pkgs/container/unit)

```
docker pull ghcr.io/tiredofit/docker-unit:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

The libraries to support the various bases above have been built, but will need actual runtimes in the image to operate. Use a downstream image to support it.

##### Downstream Images

 - [tiredofit/unit-php](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-unit-php)

#### Multi Architecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [compose.yml](examples/compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

### Creating configuration

This image expects that you place files into the `/etc/unit/sites.available` directory along with setting the variable `UNIT_SITE_ENABLED`.

- The image will look all or some of the following files:
  - `$UNIT_SITE_ENABLED-listener.json` - Configuration of the listening port, IP, and what to do upon recieving a connection
  - `$UNIT_SITE_ENABLED-uptream.json` - Configuration of the upstream to pass traffic to. This is an optional file and not used regularly
  - `$UNIT_SITE_ENABLED-route.json` - Configuration of route configuration for above listener. This dictates the files to respond to and how to route to an application
  - `$UNIT_SITE_ENABLED-application.json` - Configuration of the application, which can perform certain actions or call application engines based on the name

See the [Unit Configuration](https://unit.nginx.org/configuration/) to understand how this works.

Sample `site-listener.json` file:

```
{
  "{{UNIT_LISTEN_IP}}:{{UNIT_LISTEN_PORT}}": {
    "pass": "routes"
  }
}
```

Sample `site-route.json` file:

```
   [
      {
         "action":{
            "share": "{{UNIT_WEBROOT}}/$uri"
         }
      }
   ]
```

If you do not create any configuration, a default configuration will be created, and a sample HTML page will be generated if requested to show that the server is working.

### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory       | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `/var/log/unit` | Logfiles    |
| `/www/html`     | Web root    |

* * *
### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`,`nano`.

## Maintenance
### Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell.

```bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is) bash
```


### Controlling Configuration

Once inside the container - there is a utility `unit-control` that will allow you to perform various configuration functions such as:

  - `show` Configuration
  - `import` a file to configureation - This will clear all configuration unless you use additional arguments (undocumented)
  - `edit` in place running configuration with editor such as `nano` (set via `$EDITOR`)
  - `test` if the control socket is able to be accessed
  - `clear` all the running configuration
  - `stats` show statistics of the running instance and applications
